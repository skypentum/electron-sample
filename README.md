# Notice
다음의 소스는 Electron 공식 사이트에서 제공하는 quick start 소스이며, 이를 바탕으로 sample code를 작성하고자 한다. 

#Source 실행
```bash
$ npm start
```
#Source build
```
# OS별로 build 된다.
$ npm run build 
# (Option) ASAR을 이용하여 Source 공개를 하지 않고 앱으로 build 하는 방법 - linux / Mac 모두 되지만 window는 안됨 ㅠ
$ npm run package
```

# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
